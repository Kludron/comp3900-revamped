Name: Liam Godfrey

Week: 2-3
=========================

What I did
-------------------------

Added all epic stories, four of which with their user stories, to Jira Roadmap. (Six Epic stories, 16 User stories)
I added the epic stories and user stories for Searching for recipes, Viewing recipes, Engaging with the recipe (up-voting, commenting etc.) and Contributing (by adding your own recipe etc.).

Who I worked with
-------------------------

I was tasked with completing all of the epic and user stories with Nathan. I've worked on these ones, and then Nathan is set to do the others. At this point in time, there should be two remaining Epic stories' user stories left for Nathan to do, and then two epic stories (and novel functions) that will be added at a later date (worked on by the team).

Week: 3-4
