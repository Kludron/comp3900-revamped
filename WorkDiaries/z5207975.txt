You should also include in this diary the following information (if applicable) about the project
progress:
- what was planned for the period since the last work diary entry
- what was finished
- what were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were overcome (or what was
	tried and did not work)
- what was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project progress and what
	adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not endangered 
- what is planned for the next period (e.g., next week)

Week 1
	Group was formed. We brainstormed novel ideas for each of the project options and chose
	the project that had the most interesting novel idea. The group decided on moving forward
	with the Recipe Recommendation system. Next week we plan to finalise the functionalities
	of this system.

Week 2
	We were confused about the definition of the 6 functionalities so we spent the lab clarifying
	our understanding with the tutor. Towards the end of the lab we made a start on listing out our
	functionalities. The team plans to use the remainder of the week to finalise the functionalities.

Week 3
	The functionalities were finalised and tasks were delegated to the team. Bill and Edmond were
	responsible for the storyboards and flowcharts while Liam and I were to work on the user stories.
	After finishing the user stories, Liam and I are going to work on part B of the project proposal
	and get that finished by Saturday Wk3
