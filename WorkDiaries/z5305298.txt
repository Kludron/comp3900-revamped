    In tuesday meeting, we discussed how to revise the flow diagram. "My Recipe" page should be aggregate with "Recipe Contribution" page. Diet tracking functionality should be added.Color should be added to differenciate user's access.
    After meeting, I did what we discussed in meeting. Besides, I add new functionalities. Users can post.Users can add friends and see their posts. Users can add exercise they did. The system can calculate users' calorie according to their diet and exercise. However, I discarded some of them after discussion.
