4,Butter Chicken,"Butter chicken, or murgh makhani, is a popular Indian dish that was created by chance in 1947 in Delhi, India when a restaurant mixed together leftover chicken and a creamy tomato sauce. The sauce was made with a mixture of cream and butter, which is why it became known at “butter chicken.”",6,3,4,1,"Step 1: Marinate the chicken

In a large bowl, mix together the yogurt, lemon juice, spices and salt until well combined. Add the chicken thighs and stir well to coat. Cover and let sit for 30 minutes or refrigerate until you are ready to cook. The chicken can marinate for up to 24 hours, but no less than 30 minutes.

Step 2: Sear the chicken

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken, but do not shake off excess yogurt mixture. Sear the chicken to lock in the juices for 2-3 minutes on each side. The chicken does not need to be cooked through as it will finish cooking later in the sauce. Place the chicken into a bowl or on a plate and cover. Set aside.

Step 3: Prepare the sauce

Heat ghee in the same skillet. Add the onions and saute until they begin to soften, scraping up any browned bits left from the chicken. Add the ginger and garlic and cook for 1 additional minute. Add the cumin, coriander and garam masala and continue to cook for about 1 minute.

Next, add the tomatoes to the skillet, along with the chili powder and salt. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, until the mixture thickens and it has a deep red color. If you have chopped your onion, garlic and ginger finely you can leave the mixture as-is, but if you want a super smooth sauce, spoon the contents of the skillet into a blender and pulse until smooth. If the mixture is too thick, add 1-2 tablespoons of water.

Step 4: Return the chicken to the pan

Pour the blended mixture back into the skillet and add in the cream, sugar and fenugreek (if using). Stir the mixture to combine and then add the chicken to the sauce along with its juices. Simmer the chicken for an additional 8-10 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick.

Step 5: Serve the chicken"
