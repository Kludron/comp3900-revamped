4,Butter Chicken,"Butter chicken, or murgh makhani, is a popular Indian dish that was created by chance in 1947 in Delhi, India when a restaurant mixed together leftover chicken and a creamy tomato sauce. The sauce was made with a mixture of cream and butter, which is why it became known at “butter chicken.”",6,3,4,1,"Step 1: Marinate the chicken

In a large bowl, mix together the yogurt, lemon juice, spices and salt until well combined. Add the chicken thighs and stir well to coat. Cover and let sit for 30 minutes or refrigerate until you are ready to cook. The chicken can marinate for up to 24 hours, but no less than 30 minutes.

Step 2: Sear the chicken

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken, but do not shake off excess yogurt mixture. Sear the chicken to lock in the juices for 2-3 minutes on each side. The chicken does not need to be cooked through as it will finish cooking later in the sauce. Place the chicken into a bowl or on a plate and cover. Set aside.

Step 3: Prepare the sauce

Heat ghee in the same skillet. Add the onions and saute until they begin to soften, scraping up any browned bits left from the chicken. Add the ginger and garlic and cook for 1 additional minute. Add the cumin, coriander and garam masala and continue to cook for about 1 minute.

Next, add the tomatoes to the skillet, along with the chili powder and salt. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, until the mixture thickens and it has a deep red color. If you have chopped your onion, garlic and ginger finely you can leave the mixture as-is, but if you want a super smooth sauce, spoon the contents of the skillet into a blender and pulse until smooth. If the mixture is too thick, add 1-2 tablespoons of water.

Step 4: Return the chicken to the pan

Pour the blended mixture back into the skillet and add in the cream, sugar and fenugreek (if using). Stir the mixture to combine and then add the chicken to the sauce along with its juices. Simmer the chicken for an additional 8-10 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick.

Step 5: Serve the chicken"

8,Scallop Tortellini ,A fancy Italian staple that will leave you going MMMMMMMmm.,3,3,3,4,"1. To make the pasta, place flour, salt, eggs and water in a food processor and process until dough is formed. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and set aside in the fridge to rest.
2. To make the scallop filling, place fish in a food processor and blend to a smooth purée and, with the motor running, add the egg white. Pass through a fine sieve into a clean, chilled bowl and stir in the cream with a wooden spoon. Add scallops and chives gently mix together. Season and place in fridge.
3. Once rested, use a pasta machine to roll the dough out to the thinnest setting. Lay the pasta out on a floured work surface and cut out 9cm diameter circles. Set aside.
Place a tablespoon of scallop mix in the center of each pasta disc. Brush lightly around one half of each tortellini with a little water, then fold over to form a half-moon. Form into tortellini shape. Set aside in the fridge to firm.
4. To make the verjuice and citrus butter sauce place the verjuice into a small saucepan with the four citrus peels and bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Cook until nearly completely reduced, about 5-10 minutes. Add the cream, return to a simmer and reduce by half again. Remove the pan from the heat and slowly whisk in the chilled butter, a few cubes at a time, until it is all thoroughly incorporated. Strain into a clean pan and add the lime juice, chives and salmon caviar. Set aside.
5. To make the crispy leek and herb salad heat vegetable oil in a saucepan set over high heat, 10 180C. Fry the leeks until golden brown, remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towel. Transfer to a bowl, add herbs and gently mix together. Set aside.
6. Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Cook the chilled tortellini, a few at a time, until they float to the surface, around 2­3 minutes. Remove the tortellini carefully and place in a colander.
7.To serve, place a little salad in the center of each serving bowl. Add 3 cooked tortellini to each bowl and drizzle with sauce."
