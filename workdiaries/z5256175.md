Name: Liam Godfrey

Week: 2-3
=========================

What I did
-------------------------

Added all epic stories, four of which with their user stories, to Jira Roadmap. (Six Epic stories, 16 User stories)
I added the epic stories and user stories for Searching for recipes, Viewing recipes, Engaging with the recipe (up-voting, commenting etc.) and Contributing (by adding your own recipe etc.).

Who I worked with
-------------------------

I was tasked with completing all of the epic and user stories with Nathan. I've worked on these ones, and then Nathan is set to do the others. At this point in time, there should be two remaining Epic stories' user stories left for Nathan to do, and then two epic stories (and novel functions) that will be added at a later date (worked on by the team).

Week: 3-4
========================

What I did
------------------------
Finished off user stories and started with our sprint one backend. The first of these tasks were to design the backend architecture. I worked on this while on call with Bill and Nathan who also helped in the design strucute. I also set up a backend postgres sql server, hosted externally. With this, I also set up the backend code to connect to the postgres server.

Week: 4-5
========================

What I did
------------------------
This week was more work on the backend for sprint one. The main objectives of this was to get the authentication side working. The code that I worked on was getting the backend sql server to link with our api server, creating the authentication paths (login & skeleton of register), as well as completing a basic search function.

Week: 5-7
========================

What I did
------------------------
These weeks, I fleshed out the search function more, adding a search by recipe name and ingredients, mealtype, as well as working on various other bug fixes. I also worked on various backend setup scripts.

Week: 7-8
========================

What I did
------------------------
This week was a big push, I worked on adding cuisines to the database (and search), as well as finalising the dynamic sql search function. I fixed the backend automation script, fixed the profile etc.

Week: 8-9
========================

What I did
------------------------
Worked on the edit_recipes functions, as well as fixing more bugs with comments, profile, pretty much all other routes. Worked with Nathan to grab a big ingredients list from USDA to import into the server, 

Week: 9-10
========================
This final week was mostly debugging a lot of code, cleaning up functions and working on other basic functions such as recently viewed / favourited recipes / my_recipes.

All components I worked on
==========================

Almost all of the backend error handling, authentication, searching, contributing.
In authentication, I worked on the login, updating viewed recipes, jwt\_refresh, authenticating recipe uploader, getting profile information, and debugging all of the rest of the authentication functions.

I worked on all of the searching functions

I worked on the edit recipes function, and also debugged the post recipes function, as well as writing the commenting / recipe review function.

I also transitioned functions out of the main file to clean up the look (but this was ultimately not utilised for everything)

I was also the person responsible for the backend sql architecture and handled all changes / automations / setup of the psql server.
